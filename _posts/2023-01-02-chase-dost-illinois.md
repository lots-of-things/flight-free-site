I'm pledging to fly less because I can't fly in good conscience, but I also live far from family. I've made the decision to only fly to visit family from now on--meaning no more vacations to far-off places--and to use trains instead when possible. It's a sacrifice, but I feel it's a sacrifice more people need to make.
