I have always felt flying was perverse. It is not only utterly unnatural for humans to fly off into the atmosphere, it is uniquely natural to humans to believe they should do so, as in, "If we can do something, we should do something." While we can do so little about our complicity in shipment by air, albeit humans or cargo, let's do what is within our control - don't fly. I will get in my 32 mpg car (not an EV, because EV's are also a natural resource nightmare - so pick your poison), drive to my mountains, seas, deserts and the like, west of the Continental Divide. I am human. I am ambulatory, nomadic, and curious. I live in the West, but my family lives in the East. That's what Skype and Facetime are for. Any true relationship accommodates distance. And then after we stop flying, we can stop having children. Oh, that pesky population problem. . .
