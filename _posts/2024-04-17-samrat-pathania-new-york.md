The future of our families (our children, their children,...) is at grave risk from the twin catastrophes of ecological destruction and climate change. But we can't seem to get rid of the collective malaise of helplessness that we seem resigned to. The helplessness is not grounded in fact, but in selfishness, in convenience, in delusion. I refuse to be deluded. I have not been on a plane in 12 years. I have only flown 4 times in my life. I commit to not flying except in a family emergency. Additionally, I live in a Net-Zero home and coach others to decarbonize their lives as well.
