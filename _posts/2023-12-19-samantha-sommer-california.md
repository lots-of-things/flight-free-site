As a witness to the ongoing destruction of our beautiful planet, the fun of traveling to far away places that once filled my soul with delight, is replaced by sadness, guilt, and a conscience that doesn't have room for that kind of pleasure anymore.  I know the problem is systematic, but I fiercely believe that everything we do matters...every. little. thing. I want to make any kind of positive impact I can, and I consider this a small sacrifice in the face of what is happening to our beloved, precious,  Pachamama.  I hope to teach by my example and to inspire others to do the same, the way that others here have inspired me.
