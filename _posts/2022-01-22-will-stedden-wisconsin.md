I stopped flying in 2019 to better align my actions with my values. Since then I've learned just how amazing local travel is and how it gives me the opportunity to become so much more connected to a place. But in our upside-down world where flying to a distant resort has become easier than visiting a neighbor, it's hard for people to imagine just how amazing their own backyard can be. That's why last year my partner and I started the Trail Cooperative (cooptrail.org) as an attempt to make a local sustainable travel community. Our goal is to make local travel easy and affordable, and recruit more people to take local outdoor vacations. We're currently cycling the US to collect resources and build a network of local travel communities. Be sure to check us out if you'd like to get involved with out mission.
