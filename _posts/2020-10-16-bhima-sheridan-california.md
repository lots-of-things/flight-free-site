I am pledging to be flight free in 2021 because I believe that burning hydrocarbons in our outer atmosphere is contributing to the destruction of this very delicate film of air that protects us from the sun's more harmful rays. I learned about global warming in college in a survey course on energy and resources, and the emphasis was always on carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In fact, recent scientific studies indicate that for aviation, the non CO2 combustion byproducts are twice as bad as the CO2 emitted from the tailpipe.
