My husband and I have not flown since 2017. There are several reasons for this...chiefly, flying is no longer "fun" - it is a chore, a bore, anger-causing, arduous, and unrewarding. When flying becomes that troublesome, why fly? Our climate concerns were certainly a part of that decision. We did not own a car for the 25 years that we lived in Chicago, we did not need one, and we did not want one. We moved to Los Angeles 15 years ago and it was then that we bought our first car - a hybrid - but in 15 years we still have not put 80,000 miles on it. We have watched California and the world transform during the 15 years we have been here. Drought and horrible wildfires that destroyed our favorite State Park (Malibu Creek) have only grown worse and worse during our time here. We do whatever we can to make the situation better. Not Flying is the least we can do! But we will never fly again...
