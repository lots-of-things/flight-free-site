I have been drawn to climate action since 2008, the year my twins were born. I stopped flying for work in 2021 and for pleasure in 2019. The last time on an airplane I looked out the window and had a sinking feeling of what lay ahead in terms of the work to decarbonize, not only travel, but other sectors as well. I had previously petitioned an employer that we draft a sustainability policy for the entire company so we could make sure to fly only when absolutely necessary — it wasn't adopted before I left the position. I recently interviewed for a job and shared my no-fly pledge. A no-fly pledge is a commitment to stop emitting tons of carbon as well as bringing an individual action forward and talking about climate action and sharing the pledge with others. Not to mention, flying is a climate justice issue as many cannot afford to fly — and yet those who can least afford to fly are most affected by our emissions. I happen to love trains (relaxing and you can read!) and you can get to so many places in the U.S. by train. I also had an amazing bicycle trip with my son this summer (which included a ferry). Bicycling is an incredible way to experience not only a community, but all the flora and fauna (and smells!) that you might miss in a car or train. Highly recommend it!
