I've been "flight free" since 1996 and have no plans to change, unless I have to - and I hope I never have to!Of course, attempting to stick to passenger train transport (with the occasional side-order of motor coach and/or rented automobile) can be quite difficult in these United States, but I'm nothing if not hardheaded!
