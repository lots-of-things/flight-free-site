Following from the pandemic, I pledged to not fly anymore based on two premises—one that it is great to use sustainable alternative transportation and see more of the countryside, and the second is that with the societal changes evident now of saying and doing whatever one chooses irrespective of the consequences, makes for flying not what it used to be. I have been flying since the early seventies worldwide and it has totally lost its luster, in every way possible.I do not see myself flying again as I am afraid that I will say or do something that will result in personal hardship. I still get to where I need to be without any of the stress related to airline travel, while doing my part intrinsically in reducing my carbon footprint.
