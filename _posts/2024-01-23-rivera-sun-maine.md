During the pandemic, as my industry shifted to online trainings, I saw how much we could reduce our carbon emissions. By making a pledge not to fly, I've pushed my nonprofit organization to build a regional trainers network that increases skills throughout the US and keeps our collective carbon footprint low. I hope it inspires other networks to do similarly.Author ofThe Dandelion InsurrectionandThe Way BetweenWebsite:www.riverasun.comEditor ofNonviolence NewsAdvisory Board Member,World BEYOND WarAdvisory Board Member,Backbone Campaign
