I want to reduce my negative impact on global climate change as much as possible. We installed solar panels on our house roof, bought an electric car, grow a lot of food in our small urban yard, limit the use of our car, & buy mainly used clothing. The last two times I visited a friend far away, I took the bus instead of driving my then gasoline powered car. I want to find a climate friendly replacement for my natural gas burning furnace. We must each do as much as possible to change our behaviors for the life of the plants.
