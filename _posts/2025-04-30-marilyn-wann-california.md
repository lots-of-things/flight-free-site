I am not willing to fly, because even with an N95 mask, I would risk getting covid, which can do lasting harm. I am not willing to fly because the Republican administration is making flying unsafe. I am not willing to fly because my interest in the world is not worth destroying the world.Marilyn Wann, author of “FAT!SO? Because you DON'T have to APOLOGIZE for your size!”http://www.fatso.com/
