I haven't flown since 2018, around the time that I realized we needed to take more dramatic action to reduce emissions if we are to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. While I know that systemic change, not just individual actions, is what's necessary to turn things around, I do think that we can all do our part to help make that happen. This is especially important for people who live in parts of the world responsible for historic emissions contributions, such as myself.
