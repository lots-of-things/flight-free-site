In 2018, a family member and I went to Italy and The Netherlands to visit friends and family. When we returned, I asked him if he had enjoyed the trip. He told me he hadn't because of the carbon footprint. I replied that I had made an additional donation above and beyond my monthly subscription to Treesisters in order to offset the flights. He explained that until carbon was being removed from the air, no amount of offsets would suffice. I haven't flown since. Instead I explore the beautiful state that I live in, by bus. I feel disappointed that our rail and bus systems have degraded to the point where it's hard to travel efficiently to other states. But as long as I'm respecting this breathtakingly beautiful planet that honors and provides for our needs, I feel content.
