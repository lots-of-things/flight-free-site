I couldn't claim to be concerned about the climate crisis and continue to fly. I can't expect to improve transit options across the US if I continue to fly. Now that I've been traveling cross-country by train, I recommend it to anyone who will listen that "it's not perfect, but it's the civilized way to travel." I've met interesting people, seen more of the country, and really enjoyed the much more relaxed experience.
