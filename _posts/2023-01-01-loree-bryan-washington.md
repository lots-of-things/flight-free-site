I have always dreamed of visiting many places in Europe, but the earth is more important to me than my little travel dreams. Instead, I will focus on local travel and railway travel within the United States. There are so many beautiful places right here, why would I foul the earth by flying? The earth is giving us many messages right now, and she is crying out for us to focus on our needs above our wants.
