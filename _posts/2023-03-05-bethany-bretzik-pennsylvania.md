The climate crisis demands immediate action from every person, family, company, and government on the planet, but most especially from those who live in wealthier countries. Recreational flying is one of the worst actions people take against the environment, due to all the emissions created by airplanes. That is why my husband and I pledge to go flight-free for the remainder of our lives. We will only travel via more sustainable methods, and we will find many amazing wonders right in our local area!
