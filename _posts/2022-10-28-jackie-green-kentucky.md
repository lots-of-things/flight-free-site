When did you stop flying, and why?In 1993 a reading of World Watch Institute'sState of the World, followed by other books, all from Perth Australia's public library, resulted in an awareness of the chaotic consequences of climate warming. That awareness resulted in a decision to become flight free. A final flight was made that same year from Perth to Louisville KY.In 1999 the commitment to living local lightly was deepened when my old truck was given away to a local farmer. Still in Louisville, happiness, peace and hope is grounded in walking, cycling, public transit, gardening and deep investment in urban real estate, civic life and local community. Our immediate action will reduce the chaos of climate warming.
