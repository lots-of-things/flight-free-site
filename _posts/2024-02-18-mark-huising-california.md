I'm an academic who used to fly a lot professionally. Invitations to far away places to talk about science are treated as a sign of academic excellence, but one that comes with a climate cost that many of my colleagues do not want to be reminded of. I've largely cut out my professional flights, declined invitations to travel overseas and replaced some regional trips with train or carpool. I still travel by plane to my native Europe, where our entirely family still lives, prioritizing those infrequent flights with my kids to stay connected their relatives over the high number of professional flights that are normalized in academia.
