I've stopped flying since February 2023, after I decided to move back home with my parents in order to better look after them (my Dad is 97 years old as of this writing). I. Don't. Like. Flying. I never have. Adding meaningless significant distance from the people I care about most looks downright silly in hindsight, but hey, I had my reasons, and those reasons changed.Since studying more about environmental sustainability and sustainability leadership through leaders likeJoshua Spodek, Robin Greenfield, and others, it came to my attention that I'd rather "travel" much more locally, and by any means other than by car where I can help it, and I can really help it!Less is more in so many ways. Sacrifice is beholden to a lot of perspective, as there's so much to gain from not flying. Not everyone agrees, and that's okay - people are weird and live in dual states of conflicting interest all the time. I hope this pledge and story at best remind others to help those around them be true to themselves and what they really care about.
