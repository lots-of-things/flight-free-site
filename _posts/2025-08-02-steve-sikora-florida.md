Since the summer of 2022, I decided to go flight-free (and also car-free) — I have used my bike and the train to cover all of my traveling wants and needs. And these are changes I have thoroughly enjoyed making! My experience has taught me that being intentional about how we travel helps put a lot of things in the right perspective. I look forward to keeping this commitment during the climate emergency we are living in and beyond.
