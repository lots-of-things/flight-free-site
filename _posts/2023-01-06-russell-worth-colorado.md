I stopped driving until EVs charged with renewable energy were a possibility. I won't fly until the same is possible with air travel. I feel like more people, particularly those in higher income brackets, should consider alternatives to our mostly dirty modes of travel.  EVs grew from prototypes into a mass-produced market in a relatively short time frame due to demand.  I believe the same can be achieved with air travel.  I love to road trip, but stopped driving, sold my car in 2008 and refused to drive again until a renewable energy vehicle became a possibility.  As much as I enjoy international travel, my conscience simply won't allow me to fly until we can bring renewable energy into aeronautics. It gives me great positivity and hope to know that there are others trying to make a difference and quite possibly save this beautiful planet from man-made destruction.
