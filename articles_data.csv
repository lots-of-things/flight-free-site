There are 1400+ million metric tons of carbon in the melting permafrost; this is just one example of positive carbon emission feedbacks the planet is facing. Furthermore, AI and bitcoin are energy intensive, which is sending the earth's carbon footprint in the wrong direction.I am an outdoor enthusiast, but I find no reason to fly to the Alps, Patagonia, and other foreign mountain ranges to backpack and climb. The Wind River range, the Sierra Nevada, the Canadian Rockies. and other destinations in North America offer at least as much in scenery and adventure as those to which you have to fly. Moreover, they can be reached by driving an electric vehicle. I'm extremely happy to venture into our own mountains without flying 10-20 hours to crowded mountains overseas.",/images/Rick+Watts.jpeg,https://flightfree.org/stories-6/rick-watts-california,2025-08-29-rick-watts-california.md

Given the climate emergency we're in, it's really a no-brainer to simply stop flying. The sooner more of us forgo planes and opt for trains, bikes, electric cars, etc., the sooner the air-travel industry will come up with a way to fly carbon-free. As long as dirty flying is popular (and profitable), they have little motivation to change their ways. I sometimes think about the sacrifices my father and mother made during WWII in order to save our country and the world from certain doom.

Due to a midlife career change, my flying shot up quite a lot after age 40, with multiple airplane trips to cities across the country. I was a touring musician, and airfare was covered by whomever hired me for the gig as part of my contract. I hated how much I was flying but could do nothing about it without jeopardizing my career and the number of gigs I was booking. That all changed last fall. After a lifetime of working with my hands in various fields, I began to experience severe pain and was diagnosed with advancing arthritis at age 60. My music career ended, and with it came forced semi-retirement. While I ache at no longer being able to play my instrument, I am greeting the greater amount of free time with more walks and bicycle rides around my neighborhood, and recently decided that I no longer needed to board an airplane. Other than an emergency trip to help an elderly parent who lives out of state, I see no reason or need to travel by air anymore. When my parent is gone (which will likely happen sooner rather than later) I will no longer need to fly even for an emergency. The yearlong pledge is an experiment.

"Heather MacLeod, California",Ariella Granett,2024-04-05 00:00:00 +0300,"2024: I'm taking this one year at a time! Last year was my first flight-free year. At the beginning of 2023 I took monthly trips from Oakland to San Diego, and discovered that the Flix bus drives through the night to get me back home in time to work the next day. I managed to avoid flying even though I had a family wedding to attend on the opposite side of the country. I took the train round trip from California to Rhode Island (and then ""stopped by"" Georgia), and it worked just fine! So far so good!2023: When I learned that air travel burned more fossil fuels than any other form of travel, it was easy to understand WHY I wanted to fly less. How to do it in a way that lets me be with people I love has been the challenge.For the last 10 years I've been experimenting with riding the bus (Flix or Greyhound) or taking train from my home in Oakland to San Diego, Las Vegas & LA, where most of my family are. Driving my electric car became an option when I got one. I had to change my idea of travel, by making the driving part of the vacation.(as opposed to the work I had to do before the vacation happened)My best success was last summer, when a friend drove down with me to Ventura, and we spent the night near the beach in Ventura. Then he took the train back north while I drove on to San Diego. On my way back from San Diego, I met up with another friend who had taken the train to San Luis Obispo. We spent the night at the youth hostel there, enjoyed the town, and then meandered up the coast for 3 - 4 days before going home.I'm still aiming for a 100% flight free year. I almost made it last year, but I felt too desperate about helping Warnock win, so I flew to GA to knock on doors. This year I'm researching how I can drive my electric car to a family wedding in Rhode Island. (I've never driven my Bolt across the country.)I think the secret is clearing out the time, and having fun along the way. Being able to work a little on zoom as I travel is helpful. Having my brother come along will make it more fun, and will give me even more time with family. It's also useful to remember that spending money on campsites or hotel rooms is just part of the vacation expenses - and that when it comes to the climate, some of the ways I habitually try to save money may actually hurt the planet.",/images/Heather_Marco_train-photo.jpg,https://flightfree.org/stories-5/heather-macleod-california,2024-04-05-heather-macleod-california.md

Adding meaningless significant distance from the people I care about most looks downright silly in hindsight, but hey, I had my reasons, and those reasons changed.Since studying more about environmental sustainability and sustainability leadership through leaders likeJoshua Spodek, Robin Greenfield, and others, it came to my attention that I'd rather ""travel"" much more locally, and by any means other than by car where I can help it, and I can really help it!Less is more in so many ways. Sacrifice is beholden to a lot of perspective, as there's so much to gain from not flying.

"Evelyn Wallace, Oregon",Ariella Granett,2024-01-23 00:00:00 +0300,"If you had asked me a little over a year ago the likelihood of me giving up intended flying for the rest of my life, I would have assured you the likelihood was slim to none, probably closer to none. I was a world traveler and proud of it. I had explored other cultures, lived among communities as a cultural minority, and done the hard work of breaking out of my own comfort zone. I was living life the right way, wasn’t I?That all changed in early 2023, when I somewhat accidentally stumbled into a Sustainability Leadership workshop lead byJosh Spodek. It was never suggested to me that I give up flying. In fact, it was never suggested to me that I do anything particular, sustainability-wise. “Ten Little Things You Can Do To Save The Environment” this approach was not.Instead, I was lead into reflecting on my own values, and into seeing where my life could use… shall we say, a little more alignment between my values and behaviors. In the workshop, the shape this alignment took was up to me. My first actionable change was a moderately hesitant commitment to ride my son to day care once a week instead of drive. I did it. And you know what? It was fun! I found I wanted to do it more. It wasn’t long (a few months?) before I had fallen in love with biking: the speed, the combination of commute and workout, the exposure to the best skyscapes, the astounding number of “hellos” and connecting with new and old friends… not to mention the financial liberation from filling up the gas tank. In addition to biking, I started looking at my food differently (why did it all come with so much free trash?). I started looking at my energy use differently.Over the course of the next year, living in alignment with my own values turned into a recognition that polluting hurts people, and that flying is one of the polluting-est things humans do. So, I could either continue a behavior that I knew to be out of alignment with my own values… or I could change that behavior.I took my last intended flight in May of 2023 from Oregon to New York. It was a farewell of sorts, and an opportunity to meet--in person--my two mentors: one my sustainability teacher and one my Hip Hop Teacha. Now, when I ride my bike coast to coast to reconnect with these mentors in 2025, I will have had one in-person point of contact with each of them prior to the journey. It doesn’t make taking that last flight benign, but that was the decision I made, and why.I envision a future where our global culture shifts, and air travel (as well as all polluting, unsustainable activities as a whole) is/ are seen as an old fashioned thing: a thing we did before we knew better. And I’m proud to do my part in offering living proof that it is really quite fun on the other side.",/images/IMG_4747.jpg,https://flightfree.org/stories-5/evelyn-wallace-oregon,2024-01-23-evelyn-wallace-oregon.md

We buy and consume predominantly organically produced food that is locally grown and in season. We have bought and driven only the most high mileage vehicles starting with our first hybrid in 2003, moving onto a plug-in hybrid, and now drive an EV which requires no consumption of fossil fuels. We live in Davis, California where it gets very hot in the summer. To stay comfortable, we use a whole house fan instead of the air conditioner unless we have an extended heat wave of over 100 degrees. We used to travel with our family every year to Hawaii and occasionally to Europe. My wife and I had planned a trip to Europe in early 2020. Then the pandemic hit and we had to cancel our plans. I was very disappointed at first, but this event gave me the opportunity and time to reflect on the consequences of air travel. Why, I asked myself, do I embrace all these environmentally friendly activities when I still fly and pump out enormous amounts of CO2 as a result? I have been retired for 13 years, am a healthy 72 years old, and thought that this time of my life would be my chance to see the world. But my thinking has changed. I have decided to only travel by air if family events such as funerals and weddings require such. Traveling by air for pleasure is not conceivable for me at present. There is Amtrak, my bicycle, and our EV.

There’s pride to be had in rising up to the biggest challenge of our day and making an individual contribution.

I don't have a car, so I bike, walk, use public transit or rideshare to get where I need to go. This likely means I go fewer places, but it also means I actually process my location in the world, where I am going, and the materiality of getting there. It's only natural to extend these habits to avoiding flying. As a young person, I care more about a livable future than the convenience of fossil aviation.Too many people, including most young people I know, treat flying as a sort of birthright and undeniable privilege. To visit anywhere on Earth in a matter of hours, without having to reckon with the space in between. Particularly, to visit beautiful places without having to see the sacrificed and hurting places in between. I dream of a world where we open up to the hurting people and places of the world and do what we can to heal them, rather than fly over and make the problem worse.Chris is on the far right in this photo.",/images/0813220830_HDR.JPG,https://flightfree.org/stories-3/chris-gish-vermont,2023-02-11-chris-gish-vermont.md

It was much harder to give up traveling to see family, but last year my brother and his little clan finally moved back to Oregon, after more than 20 years in other states, so this issue has resolved - possibly at least partly because I couldn't bring myself to fly anymore.When I learned of Thunberg's choice, I finally realized what a big deal air travel is, and even without any pledge, I could no longer fly.

Losing a 2020 recital engagement in Norway to COVID prompted me to re-evaluate. Post-pandemic, I have decided to accept only local professional engagements, and to limit my flights to 1-2 times per year within the continental US for personal/vacation reasons. It’s not a perfect “flight free” solution, though my jobs require very little travel. They do, however, require a consistent onsite presence and are difficult to take off more than a few days at a time. When I do travel to maintain people/place connections from my graduate school days in Arizona, I’m thus reliant on the speed afforded by flying. However, I figure that flying out to the western US, rather than Australia/New Zealand or Europe, is a significant carbon savings. I think it would be wonderful for these “flight free” campaigns to talk more about people such as myself, who have made major reductions but not eliminated flying completely.

"Laura Hardie, Vermont",Ariella Granett,2022-12-02 00:00:00 +0300,"The train from New York to Florida marked the beginning of my flying diet. And our family loved it. Here's why I'm cutting out flying at every opportunity I can.For the Earth.Humans like to speed things up. It's not bad to want progress; it's bad when the consequences aren't considered. Now we're paying the price. Flying is one of the most destructive things a person can do to the Earth at one time. It's a complete luxury that only about 15 percent of people in the world have ever experienced. Many of the people that will never step foot on a plane will feel the worst effects of climate change, with much of it caused by fossil fuels. One 2,500 mile flight melts ~25 square feet of Arctic ice per person. That's the size of a small room for every person on the plane. The most frequent fliers make up only one percent of the world’s population, but together they account for more than half of the total carbon dioxide emission from passenger air travel (private jets are the worst offenders). So, it's no wonder we are in a mass extinction phase, the oceans are warming, the coral is dying, the rainforests are retreating, and on and on.For each other.Turns out when you speed things up, you also miss a lot. Getting somewhere isn't about the journey anymore. Instead we complain about how long we had to wait at a gate or when a flight gets cancelled. In reality, it's a miracle that humans can even travel at that pace at all. We've lost an appreciation for the journey. For slowing down. For moving alongside the Hudson River and spotting an old castle in the water, watching ships come into the harbor, and eating a meal together in a dining car.So, there you have it. We flew home from Florida because we didn't have time to train home. Yet replacing our one-way long flight there was a step forward that we could take. The train was electric most of the way, and so by choosing rail over air we prevented THREE tons of carbon from being emitted into the air (between the 4 of us). I'm flying to Puerto Rico early next year and am going to cut out half my flights by taking the train south first.Maybe there are ways you can consider cutting out flying too.The train was a beautiful, peaceful, and exciting adventure. That's something I've never said after a flight.",/images/LH.jpg,https://flightfree.org/stories-2/laura-hardie-vermont,2022-12-02-laura-hardie-vermont.md
"Jane van Dis MD, New York",Dan Castrigano,2022-11-09 00:00:00 +0300,"I have been drawn to climate action since 2008, the year my twins were born. I stopped flying for work in 2021 and for pleasure in 2019. The last time on an airplane I looked out the window and had a sinking feeling of what lay ahead in terms of the work to decarbonize, not only travel, but other sectors as well. I had previously petitioned an employer that we draft a sustainability policy for the entire company so we could make sure to fly only when absolutely necessary — it wasn't adopted before I left the position. I recently interviewed for a job and shared my no-fly pledge. A no-fly pledge is a commitment to stop emitting tons of carbon as well as bringing an individual action forward and talking about climate action and sharing the pledge with others. Not to mention, flying is a climate justice issue as many cannot afford to fly — and yet those who can least afford to fly are most affected by our emissions. I happen to love trains (relaxing and you can read!) and you can get to so many places in the U.S. by train. I also had an amazing bicycle trip with my son this summer (which included a ferry). Bicycling is an incredible way to experience not only a community, but all the flora and fauna (and smells!) that you might miss in a car or train.

A final flight was made that same year from Perth to Louisville KY.In 1999 the commitment to living local lightly was deepened when my old truck was given away to a local farmer.

When my sister declared herself to be flight-free, that got me started thinking about it. I have two young grandsons, so I feel obligated to do everything I can to reduce my own environmental impact. Making this flight-free pledge is an important next step for me. I have flown a great deal in my lifetime, starting at a very young age. My father worked for a major airline company, so my family could fly almost freely to domestic destinations and at a deep discount for international flights. Much later, in addition to vacation air travel, my job entailed air travel to international meetings and conferences. I would say that I’ve contributed more than my fair share to the carbon emissions problem.What are your travel alternatives to flying?I drive a plug-in hybrid car, I live walking distance from a public transit line that connects directly to AMTRAK, as well as major cultural centers, and the pandemic taught me that I also enjoy virtual visits to museums around the world.

I never intend to fly again except in case of an emergency, if one arises. In several ways, the journey has not been difficult for me. After 9/11, I found flying to be a tedious and tiresome experience that constantly set me on edge. I also learned that I loved train travel. I also worked as a conservation biologist; I retired from the US Fish and Wildlife Service after a 45 year career in conservation. The tipping point for me was an article I read about climate scientists deciding they could no longer justify flying to meetings all over the US and internationally because of the contribution of those flights to climate change. I felt it was my duty as well as a conservation professional to do what I could do to lessen my contribution to the climate change. I feel it is imperative that I do what I can do to help protect our biosphere for its natural communities and future generations of our species as well.What are your travel alternatives to flying?Trains, public transit, plug in hybrid car, Lyft/Uber, ebike, and walking whenever possible",/images/JN.jpg,https://flightfree.org/stories-2/jim-neal,2022-05-29-jim-neal-texas.md

That's why last year my partner and I started the Trail Cooperative (cooptrail.org) as an attempt to make a local sustainable travel community.

"Jack Hanson, Vermont",Dan Castrigano,2021-11-28 00:00:00 +0300,"In 2015, I studied abroad in Copenhagen during my junior year of college. Later that year I calculated my emissions and learned that my flight to Denmark and back had a bigger negative impact than everything else I had done that year combined. I haven’t flown since.Individual action is not nearly as important as collective action, policy solutions, and systems change. But given the extremity of the situation we are now in -- we have just a handful of years to cut global emissions in half – everything matters, including individual action.Most people have never flown. Flying is a privilege generally only available to those with means – and it is enormously polluting, causing serious harm to those on the front lines of climate collapse. From a policy perspective, we need to tax frequent flyers, as most flights are taken by a small number of wealthy individuals who fly very often. More importantly, we need major public investments in building a high-speed rail network connecting all major cities, with smaller rail lines or bus routes connecting smaller towns to those hubs.Until we get those policy solutions in place, it’s imperative that as many of us as possible forgo this destructive activity. The money we would have spent on airline tickets can help support alternative systems, like rail travel. This behavior change can also help remind everyone around us that we are indeed in a climate emergency, and therefore we need to change how we are behaving in response to that emergency. Let it be a wakeup call that can make those around us think, discuss, and act.With such little time to make major changes, we should be pushing on all of the fronts that we can. If we succeed in halving emissions in the next several years, maybe we can go back to flying then – ideally in electric planes.

I pledged to be flight free in 2020 and thought it would be easy as I still had a lot of California to explore. After the pandemic hit, I took a temporary COVID-related job in Washington state. My company approved for me to drive my car there for 14 hours instead of flying, which allowed me to make a few brief stops along the way to explore the scenery I was passing through. However once I was in Washington, I received the shocking news that my dad in Germany got diagnosed with advanced cancer. I did not expect him to live to the end of the year and knew I had to fly as soon as I could (which in itself was very difficult due to the pandemic). To mitigate the unavoidable and at least decrease emissions, I booked a direct flight. Later in the year, I went on one unexpected brief domestic flight for a business trip to Utah on a short notice.So in a sense, it may seem that I broke my pledge, but I did not fly for leisure, and I certainly could not have justified not flying to Germany under the circumstances.I now pledged to be flight free again in 2021. I have come to realize that due to my family situation I won't be able to avoid ever flying again, but I will continue to be very mindful about the environmental impact. Instead of flying in 2021, I hope to do several hiking trips with my dogs in California that I had to cancel in 2020 as a result of the pandemic.",/images/20201129_071446.jpg,https://flightfree.org/stories/melanie-alvarado-california,2020-12-09-melanie-alvarado-california.md
"Stories From Overseas: Armelle Ferguson, UK",Jenny Holmberg,2020-12-09 00:00:00 +0300,"I like to think that my sustainability story started in a very dull and conventional way. It began on my plate, to then become part of my wardrobe, and finally be a part of my lifestyle.Working in the fashion industry made me aware of the issue of sustainability, both when it comes to the planet and the people. My commitment to behavioural change has become so strong over time, that it naturally started to spill over in other areas.What touched me the most is the inequality of impact. I am aware of my relative privilege, but I also found that people who look like me, usually suffer the effects of unsustainable behaviours much more than the people who live where I live now. And yes, I love London, but my heart, my family and my culture are from a different part of the world.Having the majority of my family living in the Caribbean, it can be a challenge not to see them – also because my home island is a paradise. Still, I also know that not doing anything about the climate emergency would mean that my island will eventually sink and disappear.Not flying, to me, is not only about abstract numbers and tons of carbon emissions; it’s also about doing everything I can for my culture and my home island to still be there for my children and my grandchildren to enjoy.I know a lot of people feel that they love the Caribbean and its beautiful islands. So let’s all love the Caribbean enough to avoid contributing to its disappearance.Armelle Ferguson, London UK",/images/Armelle-pledge-scaled-e1603928782312-265x300.jpeg,https://flightfree.org/stories/armelle-ferguson-uk,2020-12-09-stories-from-overseas-armelle-ferguson-uk.md
"Dan Castrigano, Vermont",Jenny Holmberg,2020-12-07 00:00:00 +0300,"I calculated my personal emissions in 2019 and found that 85% of my emissions came from flying. That sealed the deal. October 6, 2019 was the last time I flew in an airplane. And I plan on never flying again.The climate crisis is an existential threat to all living things on this planet. We must stop burning fossil fuels as quickly as possible, and one way to do that is to stop flying. I have chosen to live a low-carbon lifestyle because I understand the scale and the severity of the climate crisis. The climate is crumbling before our very eyes. So we must act.Furthermore, flying is inherently a justice issue. Rich people fly. Poor people can not. Rich people pollute the most. Poor people pay the climate consequences first and worst. Those facing the most extreme effects of the climate crisis are Black, Indigenous, and people of color, women, children, people with disabilities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and low-income folks. Flying is not only a climate justice issue. It’s also a social justice and a racial justice issue.I understand that I have many domains of privilege. And it is my responsibility to take action simply because I can.Finally, I became a father in 2021. I have no idea what the world will look like 10, 20, or 50 years from now. And when my son grows up and asks me what I did about climate and ecological breakdown, I want to look him in the eye and tell him that I did everything I could.Dan Castrigano is one of the Flight Free USA campaigners.He runs Flight Free Vermont (Instagram,Twitter), a state chapter of Flight Free USA.He also organizes with Safe Landing BTV (website,Instagram,Twitter), a campaign demanding a 50% reduction of emissions at Burlington International Airport by 2030.***",/images/IMG_1379+%281%29.JPG,https://flightfree.org/stories/dan-castrigano,2020-12-07-dan-castrigano-vermont.md
"Rona May, Oregon",Jenny Holmberg,2020-12-07 00:00:00 +0300,"The last time I got on a plane, it was taking me from Alaska to Washington in 2014. I was watching the northern lights dance faintly through the window, and, unceremoniously, something was ending. I don’t know if I finally lost the energy to be heartbroken every time I left another place, or if the road trip up to Fairbanks – chatting and listening to music with one of my best friends, eating gas station snacks and campfire meals, and pulling the car over to get out and marvel at every breathtaking sight – made me realize how soulless and lonely flying is. For whatever reason, I was done.For me, choosing not to fly means being free to live a calmer, more abundant life. It means time to grow roots and get to work for the planet. Being part of the international flight free community means sharing the joy of meaningful action with folks around the world and celebrating how lucky we are to be able to live our values in this way.For a livable planet, I can miss the places that were still on my travel bucket list. I’d rather know those places exist – and that they and their people are safe, healthy, and protected – than ever see a single one of them. Of course, the reality is more nuanced, but quitting flying is still a simple, tangible, impactful way to participate in that hopeful future.

"Katherine, New Hampshire",Ariella Granett,2020-11-08 00:00:00 +0300,"Considering the urgency of the climate crisis and the necessity to halt carbon emissions immediately for the sake of safeguarding biodiversity and our ecosystems, there is no need (or time) to attribute blame for climate change or wallow in guilt. By being a part of the Flight Free 2021 campaign, we can have a different message: when individuals join together and shun air travel, industry and the government will need to help deliver solutions. This includes more efficient and affordable ground transport and the eventual electrification of air travel. For now, one significant way to feel content with one's environmental impact is to avoid emitting the tons of CO2 that accompany air travel.",/images/KL.jpg,https://flightfree.org/stories/katherine-new-hampshire,2020-11-08-katherine-new-hampshire.md
"Jerry Bryan, Washington",Ariella Granett,2020-11-07 00:00:00 +0300,"Flight Free 2020 provided the impetus to quit the day job that made me fly, and the relief was immediate on multiple fronts. A Flight Free 2021 vow is easy; it’s merely an extension of a deliberate choice to seek an authentic zero-carbon life. A simple life is not an impoverished life. Never again will I have to endure airports with their chronically frustrated TSA officials, postponed or canceled flights, chronically depressed and frenzied people, and the soul-sucking awareness that I am an intractable part of the problem. As an old white privileged male, a colonialist by birth, staying out of the air and on the ground offers a real opportunity for personal reform, a chance to learn to listen, and the hope of serving future generations for the common good.And it turns out that staying on the ground is just the beginning. By not flying, there is no risk of being Covid infected in a plane. I’m one less person contributing to the destruction of the Earth at 35,000 feet, and, better yet, by not flying, I had the time and money to install solar panels, which power my entire home with net-zero carbon electricity. Unlike airline mileage plans, Flight Free is the gift that keeps on giving. I’ve learned how to stay home, discovered the joy of locally grown, plant-based food, and I finally get to know my own backyard.Via the simple act of a Flight Free pledge, we’ve finally been able to start living a life informed by the Green New Deal. You have created a path to hope that starts small and then snowballs in the best of ways. The new economy, and the millions of new green jobs, are coming soon.",/images/JB.jpeg,https://flightfree.org/stories/jerry-bryan-washington,2020-11-07-jerry-bryan-washington.md
"Joy, Alabama",Ariella Granett,2020-11-06 00:00:00 +0300,"Somehow this regular American girl wound up living all over the world. As a teenager I lived in Saudi Arabia, went to school in England, and visited places like India and Kenya and Rome and so forth. In early adulthood, I thought it the most normal thing to jump on a plane to Scotland to visit friends that I’d made in Saudi, for instance.Now I understand that I have had more than my fair share of all that carbon emissions craziness (among other things). I also don’t sit in drive-throughs idling my car. I buy my food as local as I can. I garden. I plant trees (which is part of why it’s nice to sit on my back porch - - so I’m not 100% altruistic!). I make my own shampoo and all sorts of cleaning products in an effort to keep some plastic (and the untold costs of manufacturing it and shipping it) out of the waste stream.And I pledge to be flight-free not just for 2021 but for the rest of my life.",/images/Joy+Johnson+USA.jpeg,https://flightfree.org/stories/joy-alabama,2020-11-06-joy-alabama.md
"Autumn Raw, Minnesota",Ariella Granett,2020-11-05 00:00:00 +0300,"My flight-free journey began as inauspiciously as you can imagine. It was not born out of an awareness of my carbon emissions, or my desire for slow travel. It was born from the fact that I really, truly hate flying. Early in the summer of 2019, I had flown out to Washington D.C., and the flight there was so nerve-wracking, as soon as I landed I texted my mom to say I was not going to be flying back home after my two-month stay. I’ve always really hated flying, and so at the beginning, my decision to not fly was largely based on my anxiety.",/images/Picture1.jpg,https://flightfree.org/stories/autumn-raw-minnesota,2020-11-05-autumn-raw-minnesota.md

"Bhima Sheridan, California",Ariella Granett,2020-10-16 00:00:00 +0300,"I am pledging to be flight free in 2021 because I believe that burning hydrocarbons in our outer atmosphere is contributing to the destruction of this very delicate film of air that protects us from the sun's more harmful rays. I learned about global warming in college in a survey course on energy and resources, and the emphasis was always on carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In fact, recent scientific studies indicate that for aviation, the non CO2 combustion byproducts are twice as bad as the CO2 emitted from the tailpipe.",/images/BS.jpg,https://flightfree.org/stories/bhima-sheridan-california,2020-10-16-bhima-sheridan-california.md
"Ariella Granett, California",Ariella Granett,2020-10-01 00:00:00 +0300,"I helped launch Flight Free USA in 2020 as a chapter of the European campaign and with the support of volunteers, friends, and mentors. My spark was my teenage son who came home from 7th grade science and told me that the world was ending unless we acted quickly. I felt shocked to hear this message from my kid and only began to feel agency when I owned up to my own greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. I found joy and relief in choosing a lower carbon lifestyle, which then emboldened me to share and talk about the climate emergency, which has further led me to advocate for system change.There are frequent debates about the importance of individual climate action vs. system change. For me they are two sides of the same coin. I wouldn’t be able to show up for one without the other.Since my family gave up flying five years ago I have had a thousand conversations about climate change. I’ve gone on to help startwww.stopOAKexpansion.organ environmental justice coalition in opposition to my local airport expansion. Aviation is only one climate focus and I am equally passionate about building electrification, transit oriented development, walkable and bikeable cities, pressuring banks to divest from Fossil Fuels, and getting out the vote. Keeping engaged keeps me hopeful.I've chosen to not fly for the sake of the climate - I'm not waiting for climate policy to tell me this or tax me for it. Many of us are already embracing the cultural shift that needs to happen to transition off of fossil fuels and we have good stories to share in this Flight Free gallery.
