I don't want jet fuel and its exhaust poisoning the atmosphere and causing environmental disasters. I'll take Amtrak. Even though it takes a lot longer, it’s the most climate-friendly way to travel. No TSA delays, plenty of storage, and all the conveniences—food, WiFi, a place to sleep, and a shower. Plus, I get to see the country and its geography at ground level. The porters are so helpful! I love the scenicruiser cars! A good deal. No waiting for luggage! Why doesn't everyone do this?
