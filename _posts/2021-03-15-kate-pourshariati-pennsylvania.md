I’m thinking every day about Benjamin Lay and Greta Thunberg. Sometimes there are radical trailblazers that shine a light on a trail. We see that our actions are causing the natural world to collapse. The least thing we can do is not do something that makes things worse.What small luxuries can we forego? Flight is cheap but actually costs a lot to the natural world and people who live in hot climates. We don’t need to be Benjamin Lay to do something useful. May I suggest if we absolutely have to fly, then make a donation to a place that saves forest land or plants trees.Originally shared with our fly less-friends at No Fly Climate Sci:www.noflyclimatesci.org/biographies/kate-pourshariati
