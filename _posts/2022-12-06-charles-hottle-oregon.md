Why did you pledge Flight Free?There is so much to do and see in our region, which is the Pacific Northwest. Our choices in the vehicles that we drive also support lower carbon output from our travel.That's only part of it. There's the whole entitled, privilege class component. It's possible to limit those behaviors generally.
