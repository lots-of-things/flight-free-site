I stopped flying in 2008 after looking at my individual carbon footprint! This clearly was the biggest change I could make. “Living Lightly” as we happily call it has also led to all sorts of other changes and usually increasing joy. However right now many more people seem to be flying…Many thanks for putting out these pledges. I hope it helps turn many people in more deeply beneficial directions for us and for all future generations.
