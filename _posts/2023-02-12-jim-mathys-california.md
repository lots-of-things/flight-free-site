I look at our planet as a gift from GOD and not flying is a form of honoring GODS gift. Our air, water and soil are gifts to be stewarded. Christians and other faith communities should be leading the way on changing our cultural systems as a form of worship. I take trains and drive a hybrid car, looking to get an electric truck or car for our next vehicle.
