I really dislike flying commercial airlines (and LOVE the planet!), so this is a no-brainer! But I love to travel... went on a 10,000 mile cross-country RV trip a few years agoâ€”in a bit of a gas guzzler, but still better than flying. Now, I have a camper and a plug-in hybrid to tow it. Much better! Also, I'm a sailor, so when I want to go to Europe, I'll sail over myself. Keep up the good work, Flight Free USA!!
