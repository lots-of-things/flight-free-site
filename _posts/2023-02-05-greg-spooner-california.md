Aviation travel is one of the most profligate emissions activities most well off humans can do - and jet travel is just not very necessary in most cases. We can't “individual” our way out of the #ClimateEmergency, but once one truly understands the real nature of the emergency, reducing or eliminating jet travel is simply something one has to do. I haven’t flown since Sept 2019. I will be flying in the autumn of 2023 to take part in some long-delayed volunteer training work in Zambia. But I plan to stay a long while so that the big emissions associated with such a journey has the greatest benefit.  I've been involved in climate activism for some years now, and as a member of ScientistRebellion.com, I've engaged in non-violent direct actions for climate justice, including the recent campaign against private and luxury jet travel.  You can read more about that campaign athttps://makethempay.info/andstay-grounded.org.  I urge everyone to step up their personal commitment to reducing flying in their own life and to join with those of us organizing against the climate crisis.  Especially my scientist colleagues, who even today are mostly standing on the sidelines.  Please join us and reach out to me personally if you want help getting started!
