At first, I found the whole burning-our-own-home down to the ground thing too terrifying to approach full-on.I began blogging about sustainable style in about 2016. I describe sustainable style as my gateway drug to what is happening to the environment and what we're doing to the climate. I learned about sustainability in the fashion world, and how it ties in a myriad ways with sustainability in general. As I learned more and was able to hold a dialogue with my scientist sister, an effluvial geomorphologist, and other climate activists, I began to make more sustainable changes in my lifeâ€”I experienced how none of the changes were particularly hard and all of them increased the quality of my life. Making conscious choices imbued my daily tasks with grace and have helped me take a deeper pleasure in living.
