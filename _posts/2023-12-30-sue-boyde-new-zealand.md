I learned from the first XR Talk I attended in 2018 about the emissions of flying. I haven't taken a flight since then. I have reduced my emissions to around 2.5 tonnes CO2e p.a. I visit with family overseas by Zoom. I am currently privileged to be wearing a tracking cuff, EM bail for climate resistance with Restore Passenger Rail (NZ sister organisation to Just Stop Oil). We may be f*cked but I am doing my best to fight it.
