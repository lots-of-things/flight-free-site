The last time I flew was the year Greta Thunberg was born. It was nearly 10 years before that when I learned that flying is a far too significant contributor to our climate crisis. (Plus, I hate airports and love riding trains.) Personally, I am shocked that the vast majority of people who both call themselves 'environmentalists' and claim to be concerned about, and working on, the issues of our climate crisis refuse to even discuss reduction of air travel.We cannot measure how the climate crisis is being addressed by the far too often quoted hollow words of leaders and politicians. The only thing that counts is substantive action.
