If we are remembered at all by future generations it will not be for our achievements, awards, or the exotic places we visited, it will be for the answer to one question: how did we, personally, deal with climate change.I feel like the whole notion that we need to hop on a plane and travel thousands of miles has been sold to us as nothing more than a bill of goods and a costly one at that. For the past 12 years our family has been enjoying our sub-stratospheric life and discovering endless wonder just a few miles from our house.
