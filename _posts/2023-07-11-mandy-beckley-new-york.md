After a friend posted his decision to not fly anymore on social media, a huge welling of truth came up inside me and I knew it was true for me too. It doesn't make any sense that those of us in the US wouldn't have to make decisions like this as climate collapse grows big in our periphery. The more of us who make these decisions and talk to others about it, the more people may come to see themselves in these choices. It also steels me against the false notion of not being able to "do" anything. While it's clear that oil corps are the huge producers of CO2, they aren't anything without consumers. We have agency to refuse. Bonus points is that by pledging to not fly during the pandemic, we can prevent never-ending variants of COVID from spreading globally. Other than family emergencies and the dream of one trip to Italy/Ireland to see ancestral land, I will not fly in an airplane ever again.
