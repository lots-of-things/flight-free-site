Why did you pledge this year?I stopped flying in 2018 but this year was the first time I had heard about the pledge. It is also the first time that I realized that the climate crisis will now dramatically alter my 50 year old children's lives, not just my grandchildren's lives.What are your travel alternatives to flying?We drive - a Prius and average 56mpg per trip. It is not perfect but it is a lot less carbon.
