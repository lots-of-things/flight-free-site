I've been aware of the outsized impact of airline flying since becoming acquainted withwww.footprintnetwork.orgin the early 2000s. This group won the top award from the Nobel Sustainability Trust in 2024. I learned about FlightFree.org at the Kinetic Grand Championship in Humboldt County, California, where the FLYtLESS kinetic sculpture took top prize in this "triathlon of the art world." These achievements represent, in my opinion, the new definitions of "success" and "glamour." It's great to know a little about the wide, wide world, but there are plenty of ways to do that without flying in airplanes.
