“I made a permanent pledge to not fly in 1999. I have flown only once since then. It was round trip to the East Coast in 2003 for an emergency. My main modes of transportation are by electric bicycle and electric car. In my town the electricity is net zero carbon. I think your contest should also see which state has the most pledges per capita.”
