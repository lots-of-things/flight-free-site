Why did you pledge this year?Several years ago, I adopted a re-use, reduce, recycle way of living. When my sister declared herself to be flight-free, that got me started thinking about it. I have two young grandsons, so I feel obligated to do everything I can to reduce my own environmental impact. Making this flight-free pledge is an important next step for me. I have flown a great deal in my lifetime, starting at a very young age. My father worked for a major airline company, so my family could fly almost freely to domestic destinations and at a deep discount for international flights. Much later, in addition to vacation air travel, my job entailed air travel to international meetings and conferences. I would say that Iâ€™ve contributed more than my fair share to the carbon emissions problem.What are your travel alternatives to flying?I drive a plug-in hybrid car, I live walking distance from a public transit line that connects directly to AMTRAK, as well as major cultural centers, and the pandemic taught me that I also enjoy virtual visits to museums around the world. Another tool I use is voting, both with my dollars and with my ballot. This is a way I can amplify my choices.
