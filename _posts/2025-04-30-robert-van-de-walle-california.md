I'm co-captain of Team Pineapple, an arts, engineering and athletics team competing in the Kinetic Grand Championship sculpture race. Our sculpture this year is FLYtLESS, which tells the story of hyper-entitlement and climate crisis using absurdity and irony. It's an airplane crashed in Antarctica, complete with penguins and ice floes, and a destination wedding gone horribly wrong just for viral social media content. We're encouraging spectators to visit Fligh Free USA to make their own pledges to become Flight Free.https://www.trashlantis.com/adopt-a-penguin
