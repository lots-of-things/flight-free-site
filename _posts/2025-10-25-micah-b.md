I am a prospective graduate student of Natural Resources and Ecology. Although I have ironically only traveled via airline once in my adult life, I am signing this pledge to limit myself to a maximum of one round-trip flight between 2026 and 2028, and entirely eliminate air travel from thereon out. There is no way to travel by air in a way that is not ecologically detrimental within our current or future technological capabilities. We as consumers need to discontinue financially supporting airline corporations whenever possible, and instead need to create a stronger consumer demand for improved ground-based green transportation infrastructure.
