Flying is the dirtiest (most CO2-heavy) activity millions of us do every year. Given the climate emergency we're in, it's really a no-brainer to simply stop flying. The sooner more of us forgo planes and opt for trains, bikes, electric cars, etc., the sooner the air-travel industry will come up with a way to fly carbon-free. As long as dirty flying is popular (and profitable), they have little motivation to change their ways. I sometimes think about the sacrifices my father and mother made during WWII in order to save our country and the world from certain doom. Giving up flying is the LEAST we can do today to help save our country and the world from tomorrow's climate disasters.
