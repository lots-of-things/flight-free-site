Letter to the Editor, Seattle Times, Monday, December 18,Instead of “fixing" flying as the author of “Why Flying Is Miserable: And How to Fix It” describes (Nov. 28, Travel), there’s a better way to avoid the misery of aviation. Stay home! Travelers can find alternatives to in-person meetings, such as Zoom and FaceTime calls. Rather than birding in New England, take your binoculars to the Edmonds Pier. Skip that uncomfortable flight to Mexico and order tacos here in town. You’ll keep costs down, too.Because aviation represents a growing threat to the climate. you’ll also do the planet a favor.
