I was inspired a few years ago by Greta Thunberg who said she would never fly again. I already have solar panels and an electric car. I’ve also been vegan for 40+ years which is another key step to personal and global change. Going vegan is more important now than ever! I want to do my part. I am a hiker but it is getting so hot in Arizona I haven’t hiked all year. Our lives are changing so much I feel we need to make big changes at the individual level and global level.
