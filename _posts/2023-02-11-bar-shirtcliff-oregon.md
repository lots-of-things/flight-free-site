I haven't flown since learning of Greta Thunberg's refusal to fly across the Atlantic, opting instead to travel by sailboat, back in 2019. If she can find climate friendly ways to get where she needs to go, so can I!I haven't had much pushback. Employers want me to come to company parties, for which I'm supposed to travel by plane. Or they want me to travel for quarterly planning, other such things. I simply say no and explain why I feel that damaging the climate to go to a party or participate in a planning exercise is frivolous, and so far no one has pressed me further. It was much harder to give up traveling to see family, but last year my brother and his little clan finally moved back to Oregon, after more than 20 years in other states, so this issue has resolved - possibly at least partly because I couldn't bring myself to fly anymore.When I learned of Thunberg's choice, I finally realized what a big deal air travel is, and even without any pledge, I could no longer fly. I'm really pleased to see this beginning to build into a movement. Since 2019 I've felt rather alone in refusing to fly. Now I know I have at least a little company.
