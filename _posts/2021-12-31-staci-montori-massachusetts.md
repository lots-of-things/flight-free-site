“Four years ago I took a pledge to stop flying to reduce my carbon footprint and calm my intense climate anxiety. I believe the climate emergency needs an “all hands on deck” approach- individuals, towns, government and corporations ALL need to act NOW!

At first I thought it would be a sacrifice—instead it has enhanced my love for travel and our beautiful country, and it brings me immense peace and joy.
