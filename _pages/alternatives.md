This diagram compares the climate impact of different modes of transport.  
Note: The data is from Europe, where electric rail is largely powered by renewables. In the U.S., only the **Northeast Corridor Amtrak** trains are electric — most others run on **diesel**.

## How Amtrak Compares

This graph, published by Amtrak, compares the **energy efficiency** of different travel modes. However, it **does not include aviation’s non-CO₂ warming impacts**, which would place planes at the **bottom** of the efficiency ranking.  
Also note: **Car efficiency** varies based on vehicle type and number of passengers.

### Car Trips

An airliner gets roughly **30 mpg per passenger**, similar to a compact car.  
However, **compact cars with multiple passengers** outperform airliners in efficiency — and they avoid the **high-altitude, non-CO₂ warming impacts** of aviation.

### Cruise Ships

Cruise ships can be **more polluting than flying**.
