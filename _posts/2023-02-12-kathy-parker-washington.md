I pledged to not fly from 2019 through 2023 in order to reduce global carbon emissions, reduce fossil fuel consumption, reduce global spread of pandemics, and reduce my chances of catching a virus. My last flight was December 2018 to Saipan for work when I caught a cold on the plane and was sick for my whole trip. My travel will be local or within CONUS with my electric car, fueled by my PV system.
