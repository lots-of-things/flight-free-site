I strongly believe that everyone, especially those with financial means, must do everything within their personal power to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this climate emergency, every action taken to end the use of fossil fuels matters.I have an all electric car, so I have no excuse not to stop emitting carbon for travel. It's on my bucket list to plot out interim destinations for car charging (and recharging myself from driving) along the 1000 mile road trip to visit my daughter. Embracing slow travel as my new normal makes complete sense, since I am slowing down as I age. It would be nice to live by Emerson's words "it's not the destination, it's the journey".
