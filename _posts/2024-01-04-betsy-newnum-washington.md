I plan on flying 1-2 trips only, in 2024, saving them for family needs.  Retired, I can drive my car only every other day, as best as I can, walking to  grocery, drug and park nearby. When someone tells me high handedly, that the plane will fly anyway I respond that I can live with myself, and lighten some of my climate despair. I've been involved in climate actions for 10 plus years in my career, so it’s part of who I am. I've scheduled a train vacation to Glacier National Park in June.We MUST ALL do something. So happy to find this community.
