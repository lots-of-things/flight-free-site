I have not flown for over 5 years now but may be forced to in 2023 if I relocate outside the continental US. But if so, it will be a one-way, one-time flight. After that, I'll upgrade my “infrequent” pledge to “flight-free” forever. Well, not truly flight-free... I'm looking forward to hang gliding or possibly piloting a solar-powered ultralight aircraft. And by the way, train travel is awesome. Dreams and imagination put into action create a better world—we don't have to accept the status quo.
