Even though I live 1200 miles away from my family in the Midwest, my husband and I have utilized Amtrak almost exclusively over the last 15 years to make the journey to visit. In part to accommodate reduced time off work, and in part to appear less rigid, I would typically book a plane trip every couple of years to visit family who live in the Southwest. I appreciate the work of Flight Free USA to encourage us to stand together and refrain from flying as a conscientious act to reduce climate change. It really only took seeing the pledges of others to make me realize that I too no longer wish to take an occasional flight as a "normal" mode of travel. Thank you!
