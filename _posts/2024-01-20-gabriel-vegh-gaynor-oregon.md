I pledge to have less frequent air travel and to be more intentional and grateful for the ability to travel when I do. Primarily as a climate action and also as a way to commit to living fully in my local region, being more connected with my community, and experiencing the beauty and natural wealth of the fragile habitats we reside in. I work on solid waste policy and methane emissions mitigation projects and believe there is no limit to the ways we can all be climate activists!
