Why did you pledge this year?My journey to no flights began prior to the pandemic, and I have not flown since 2019. I never intend to fly again except in case of an emergency, if one arises. In several ways, the journey has not been difficult for me. After 9/11, I found flying to be a tedious and tiresome experience that constantly set me on edge. I also learned that I loved train travel. I also worked as a conservation biologist; I retired from the US Fish and Wildlife Service after a 45 year career in conservation. The tipping point for me was an article I read about climate scientists deciding they could no longer justify flying to meetings all over the US and internationally because of the contribution of those flights to climate change. I felt it was my duty as well as a conservation professional to do what I could do to lessen my contribution to the climate change. I feel it is imperative that I do what I can do to help protect our biosphere for its natural communities and future generations of our species as well.What are your travel alternatives to flying?Trains, public transit, plug in hybrid car, Lyft/Uber, ebike, and walking whenever possible
