Having worked on NASA projects for decades and being sensitive about pollution, I started reducing my air travel long ago. The pandemic added more incentive to reduce air travel, and I've only been on a plane once since then, to see family.When friends talk about their trips around the world to look at different places and things, I cringe. There's plenty to do closer to home; international travel should be a rarity, not a hobby.
