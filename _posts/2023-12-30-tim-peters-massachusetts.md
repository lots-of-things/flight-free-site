I'm committed to not flying during the climate emergency. Our planet is on fire...I don't need to add any fuel to it! There's so much diversity in my own neighborhood...of people...of plants...of philosophies. If you want to get outside your comfort zone, you can get there by foot! I'd rather build community where I am. I don't need to seek out experiences; I want to be an experience!
