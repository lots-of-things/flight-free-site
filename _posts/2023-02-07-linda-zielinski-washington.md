When I look back at the few times in my 75-year old life that I've flown, most of those times were really for entertainment, disguised as "cultural enrichment". These travels didn't make me a happier person in the long haul; giving my energy to the place I live and love does that for me! I've flown a few times to see family, but found I preferred taking buses and trains, as I missed seeing the countryside that only showed up like a video out the airplane windows. Life is lovely right where I am, no jet lag, no getting up early to catch a flight, no standing in line with frustrated travelers. Sept 11, 200l was horrible, yes. But I remember the two days of quiet skies that followed. That was dear to me. Doubt I'll experience it again
