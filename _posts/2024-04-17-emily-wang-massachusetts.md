I stopped flying last year and the benefits have vastly outweighed the downsides (if there are any downsides at all!). I got into biking for the first time and I love it - I'm now training for my first long distance bike tour. My carbon footprint is way smaller. I've explored more of my locale. And I love connecting with other people who also avoid flying and enjoy human-powered travel. I don't see any reason to fly this year.
