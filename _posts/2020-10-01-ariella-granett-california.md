I helped launch Flight Free USA in 2020 as a chapter of the world campaign. I have found joy and strength in choosing a lower carbon lifestyle, which has emboldened me to advocate for system change. There are frequent debates about the importance of individual climate action vs. system change. For me they are two sides of the same coin. I wouldn’t be able to show up for one without the other. I volunteer with www.stopOAKexpansion.org an environmental justice coalition in opposition to my local airport expansion. Aviation is only one climate focus and I am equally passionate about building electrification, transit oriented development, walkable and bikeable cities, Fossil Fuel divestment campaigns, and getting out the vote. Keeping engaged keeps me hopeful. I've chosen to not fly for the sake of the climate - I'm not waiting for climate policy to tell me this or tax me for it. Many of us are already embracing the cultural shift that needs to happen to transition off of fossil fuels and we have good stories to share in this Flight Free gallery.
