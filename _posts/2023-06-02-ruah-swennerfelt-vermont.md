My husband and I stopped mostly flying in 1995. We traveled a lot for our work and used Greyhound and Amtrak, with an occasional flight, when it was the only option. Now we tell people we don't fly except in a family emergency. We are strong advocates of Amtrak and encourage people to take the time, relax, read, meet new people, and give extra time for delays.
