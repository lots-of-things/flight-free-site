I cut down on flying two decades ago when climate science became already clear enough (and when flying also became ever less fun). With the advent of virtual meetings etc it’s become even less essential. I think I’ve flown twice in that time.I don’t preach about it, but am continually amazed and dismayed that even my most aware friends don’t feel it’s worth cutting down on even nonessential travel. “The human conscience subsist on very questionable food,” as some wise person said.
