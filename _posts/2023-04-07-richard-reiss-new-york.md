I stopped flying in 2012, the day after we interviewed Klaus Lackner, a pioneer in carbon capture. This is just a minute and a half to explain why:https://youtu.be/_4KnK9hdnxwRichard Reiss is Executive Director of The City Atlas and developed a cooperative game that shows what it takes to decarbonize NYC. It's in use at universities including Carnegie Mellon, CMU Africa, Harvard, Vanderbilt, Yale, Brown, and University College Dublin, and now also in 12 public high schools in NYC. They are working to replicate this method for every city, to help secondary schools meet the climate literacy goals of the UNFCCC Article 6 and Article 12 of the Paris Agreement. Because the game, Energetic, is accurate to the current energy mix, an updatable online version can also inform the public on what needs to be done -- this will hold governments accountable on a local level, and the sum of the local levels helps policy at the global level succeed. #PlayEnergeticCity Atlas podcast:https://newyork.thecityatlas.org/people/ro-randall/More information about Energetic, the game to decarbonize NYC:https://newyork.thecityatlas.org/people/energetic-teachers/
