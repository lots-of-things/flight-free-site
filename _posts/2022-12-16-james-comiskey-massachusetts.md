Since 2019, I have spent only 2 hours on a plane for a friend's wedding where there were no other options to get to it. I plan to continue to choose alternatives to flying indefinitely, focusing on trains and local trips instead of global trips. I have for the past few years tried to use my influence around others close to me, and have successfully avoided many trips that involved flying. Let's all run, bike, train, and carpool for a better future!
