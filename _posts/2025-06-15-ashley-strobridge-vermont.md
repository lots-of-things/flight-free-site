I haven't flown since 2001 due to my neurodivergencies, and later, due to my size due to medications I take for my neurodivergencies. I now also refuse to fly due to the dangers from FAA cuts, due to the flagrant constitutional violations of ICE, and due to the Climate Crisis that is exacerbated by flight emissions. I pledge to continue to be flight free until the Climate Crisis, and all of the other above issues, are addressed!
