I'm flight free because I care about the earth. And climate change is not only going to affect humans, but it's going to affect the animals, the plants, and everything on this earth. We need to take care of our earth, people! It's like if someone is very sick but you don't do anything. Earth is very sick and we need to take action! It's not only the earth that is going to be affected by climate change, every single living thing is going to get a part of it. We need to take action, together, as a team.
