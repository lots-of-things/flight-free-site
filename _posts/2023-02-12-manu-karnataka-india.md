It's amoral to keep emitting and leave the world so much worse off for our children and the unprotected flora and fauna of the world. If you’re not from the main historically emitting economies or not part of the boomer generation, it misses the point to say “they created this disaster, let them fix it”. Because it’s your kids in India, Africa, and the poorer parts of Asia and South America that are going to bear the burden no matter who created it. There’s pride to be had in rising up to the biggest challenge of our day and making an individual contribution. So that when your kids grow up and ask you “where were you when the world was falling apart”, you’ll have a story. What greater purpose than that can there be.
