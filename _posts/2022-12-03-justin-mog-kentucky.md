Why submit yourself to the indignity of flying and contribute to the greatest crisis facing humanity when you can simply give yourself more time to actually ENJOY traveling on a train, bus, or even bicycle? No need to go to some far-flung airport on the outskirts of town, stand in long lines, pay ridiculous fees, remove your shoes, submit to dehumanizing searches, and not be able to bring food or liquids on board...assuming you don't get bumped or your flight isn't canceled...only to travel like a sardine who can't get out of their tiny seat as you breathe stale air and wish you were actually back ON THE GROUND, where you belong. Flying is for the birds!Check out Justin’s podcast Sustainability Now!:https://www.forwardradio.org/sustainabilitynow“A deep dive into the many ways citizens are taking action to advance environmental, social & economic justice.
