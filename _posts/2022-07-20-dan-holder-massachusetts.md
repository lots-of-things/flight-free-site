I was forced to fly the friendly skies for a period of almost 30 years due to my employment for a major construction company in Texas. Towards the end of my career I became concerned about the environmental effects of wasteful production of products detrimental to the environment & our general health.  I stepped onto an aircraft for the last time in 2012. I still travel mostly from New England to the Southern States but NEVER off the ground. I miss it not.
