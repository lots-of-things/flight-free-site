Eliminating even one long-distance flight saves more carbon than my family generates at home and from the car for an entire year. I love lowering my emissions by doing less and saving money! Meanwhile, I am working for systemic change through Citizens' Climate Lobby. We need changes big and small to get to net zero - and we can do it!!
