I am 51 years old and I am pledging to not fly the rest of my life. I don’t have to fly for work. I live in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula so I don’t have to fly anywhere for beautiful forests and beaches. When I do travel I drive using a hybrid vehicle.Jon read about Flight Free USA in this article:https://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/essays/should-i-stop-flying/
