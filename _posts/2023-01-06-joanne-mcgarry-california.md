May more folks forgo flying for 2023.Since the turn of the century, I have flown roundtrip only twice from Northern California to Southern California for family funerals. I really have lost interest in air travel as a means of getting from one place to another as the time and energy and rigamarole involved is not worth any "convenience" shoving a bunch of humans into a tube to take flight to a destination involves. The climate reality necessitates a collective commitment to reducing our collective greenhouse gas emissions. It starts with me.
