My focus is on contentment where I am. The dissonance of knowing we need to curtail emissions immediately and drastically while seeing good people blithely planning flights for vacations is very painful, so I looked for others who are making this choice. I'm 49 years old and have been limiting flying and travel in general for most of my life. My most difficult flying decision is about seeing my parents who live 2 time zones away. My father was an airline employee and my early life was supported by this industry. And I'm grieving the trips I dreamed of that won't happen.
