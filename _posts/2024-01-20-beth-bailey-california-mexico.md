I have taken a class withJosh Spodekand used a carbon calculator to determine thatI had contributed 20 tons in 2023 by flying alone. I realized I wanted to change that.I live in Mexico and my children and grandchildren are in the US so I'm pledging to do one flight a year to Houston and to use busses and trains from there to visit family.
