In 2019 David had logged in 15 hours of flight time but in 2020 he became a huge advocate for rail, he belongs to theRail Passengers of America Association,and instead of flying he chose to vacation by train from his home in Kansas City, Missouri, through Arkansas to Dallas, Texas. His next train trips might be to Chicago, New Orleans, or New York and maybe a transatlantic cruise to London to see his ancestral homeland.
