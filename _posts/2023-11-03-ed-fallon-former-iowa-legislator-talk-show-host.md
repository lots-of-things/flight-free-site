“I live in the middle of the US (fly-over country, haha) and have family in Oregon, Florida, Massachusetts, and Ireland. This fall, my wife and I are visiting my family in the continental US by car (which we've done many times before). Next year, we have to make one trip to Ireland, then I'm done with flying until the climate emergency ends or an airplane fuel that doesn't worsen the climate crisis becomes available.”On October 30th, 2023 theFallon Forum radio showspoke with Flight Free campaigner Dan Castrigano about climate, aviation, and the proposed Des Moines Airport expansion. In Polk County, Iowa Public Measure A wants voters to approve a $350 million bond to expand the airport, which would have a resoundingly negative climate impact. Ed Fallon writes “If you support building a bigger airport to increase air travel, you aren’t serious about the climate crisis.”  Read and listen in athttp://fallonforum.com/climate-is-on-the-ballot/
