2024: Seems a no-brainer to me. Until planes can fly with zero emissions, I’m grounded!2023: Climate, hassles, stress - these are the main reasons I’m not flying in 2023. Each is fairly self-explanatory, so I’ll only say that it would be nice if more people would expand their moral circle to include all sentient animals who suffer.  Agriculture is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for more than the entire transport sector. So, besides not flying in 2023, I’ll not be eating any animals either. Please join me.
