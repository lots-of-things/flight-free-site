I have flown once since 2018. I drive an EV about 2,500 miles a year and am currently planning my second trip to New York via Amtrak. The train ride from Cincinnati is about 18 hours, but traveling in a sleeper car is truly enjoyable, providing time to read, think, sleep and just watch the country pass by. Thank you for launching Flight Free USA!
