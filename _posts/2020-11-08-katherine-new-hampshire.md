Considering the urgency of the climate crisis and the necessity to halt carbon emissions immediately for the sake of safeguarding biodiversity and our ecosystems, there is no need (or time) to attribute blame for climate change or wallow in guilt. By being a part of the Flight Free 2021 campaign, we can have a different message: when individuals join together and shun air travel, industry and the government will need to help deliver solutions. This includes more efficient and affordable ground transport and the eventual electrification of air travel. For now, one significant way to feel content with one's environmental impact is to avoid emitting the tons of CO2 that accompany air travel.
