I am highly worried about the future of our planet. There are 1400+ million metric tons of carbon in the melting permafrost; this is just one example of positive carbon emission feedbacks the planet is facing. Furthermore, AI and bitcoin are energy intensive, which is sending the earth's carbon footprint in the wrong direction.I am an outdoor enthusiast, but I find no reason to fly to the Alps, Patagonia, and other foreign mountain ranges to backpack and climb. The Wind River range, the Sierra Nevada, the Canadian Rockies. and other destinations in North America offer at least as much in scenery and adventure as those to which you have to fly. Moreover, they can be reached by driving an electric vehicle. I'm extremely happy to venture into our own mountains without flying 10-20 hours to crowded mountains overseas.
