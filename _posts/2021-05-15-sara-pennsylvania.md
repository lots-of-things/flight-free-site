Why did you pledge this year?We all must do all we can to reduce our individual and collective carbon footprint. We must also advocate at the state and federal level for more environmentally-friendly infrastructure, in particular high-speed rail. It's important that our elected officials know that we are giving up flying, and to demand green transportation alternatives.What are your travel alternatives to flying?I don't own a car so for regional travel I go by train, bus, or on occasion I use Zipcar (car sharing service).If you pledged last year how was it?I haven't flown in about 2 years. Being on the east coast, it's much easier to travel for leisure without flying. I took Amtrak from Philadelphia to Montreal for a vacation a few years ago which was such a great trip!
