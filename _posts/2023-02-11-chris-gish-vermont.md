There is magic to traveling patiently and slowly. I don't have a car, so I bike, walk, use public transit or rideshare to get where I need to go. This likely means I go fewer places, but it also means I actually process my location in the world, where I am going, and the materiality of getting there. It's only natural to extend these habits to avoiding flying. As a young person, I care more about a livable future than the convenience of fossil aviation.Too many people, including most young people I know, treat flying as a sort of birthright and undeniable privilege. To visit anywhere on Earth in a matter of hours, without having to reckon with the space in between. Particularly, to visit beautiful places without having to see the sacrificed and hurting places in between. I dream of a world where we open up to the hurting people and places of the world and do what we can to heal them, rather than fly over and make the problem worse.Chris is on the far right in this photo.
