Why are you flight free? Flying contributes to global warming and the continued climate crisis. This pledge was a great next step for me to go flightless for the next year knowing I have the capability to reduce my own carbon emissions through my own actions. I also love traveling in my hybrid vehicle anyway, and I have the opportunity to see more of our wonderful country by planning more stops along the way to the farther destinations. This pledge is in addition to the reduced water usage at home and increased level of waste management that Iâ€™m employing in my own life to reduce my carbon footprint.
