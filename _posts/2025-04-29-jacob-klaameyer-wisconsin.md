Drove more than the circumference of the Earth in a Prius to visit family last year on my year of no flights! A ton of travel and emissions, but still much less than flying and I was able to adventure and appreciate local cultures, flora, and fauna on the way. When back home the car sat idle as I pedaled my smiles per mile device.Cheers to all those who are trying to be better for others!
