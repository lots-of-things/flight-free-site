After many years ofour former State Senator, Rob Hogg, urging us not to fly, my wife and I decided to not fly anywhere unless we absolutely had to (death, emergency). We will drive wherever we need to go, as well as looking into train and bus travel whenever feasible. We were so happy to read the article"Planes, Trains, and Decarbonization: Is a future without air travel possible?"by Dayton Martindale in the Summer 2023 issue of the Sierra magazine. It said what we had been thinking, and it led us to the Flight Free USA website, where we can join others who've come to the same conclusion. We flew enough in our lifetimes. It's time now to repent and do as little air travel as possible.
